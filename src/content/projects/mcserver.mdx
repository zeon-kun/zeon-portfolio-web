This project showcases my ability to manage and automate a Minecraft server using a VPS. The server is set up on AlmaLinux OS with custom bash scripts to handle daily backups, restarts, and mod installations. It also supports a range of mods that enhance gameplay and server performance. My focus was on ensuring the server's reliability and ease of maintenance.
