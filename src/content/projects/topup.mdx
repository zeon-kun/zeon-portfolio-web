This project was part of a group assignment during my Framework Programming course. It demonstrates the flow of topping up game currencies using Laravel. My role involved configuring the routing and middleware, creating controllers, handling HTTP requests/responses, and designing dynamic views with Blade templates. The project serves as a practical application of Laravel fundamentals.
